# ziion_utm

This repo contains torrent files to download ZIION, from HALBORN: https://www.ziion.org

It's a linux/kali style distro loaded of pre organised tools to assess security of smart contracts, and it's really cool!
However, ZIION download site proposes only a Parallel image for people running on a MAC with ARM/M1 architecture. 

I ported that image, straight as it was, fixed virt drivers and, it works like a charm in UTM. UTM is available for free, runs native virtualisation on M1 using QEMU.

you can find UTM here: https://mac.getutm.app
